Direct volume rendering (DVR) is a visualization technique for the display of
3D scalar fields. It excels at rendering interior views of 3D scanned
objects, simulation data, or any subject lacking a well defined structure, such
as gaseous phenomena. However, a significant problem with DVR is that the
memory requirements of volume data sets quickly exceed the size of available
memory on the graphics processor.  When data exceeds available gpu memory, 
interactive visualization becomes impossible without using complex out-of-core 
rendering methods. 

Modern 3D scanning techniques and simulations produce enormous amounts of
three-dimensional data.  For example, the Biomolecular Research Institute at
Boise State University owns a micro-CT scanner that can generate high
resolution scans up to $8192^3$ voxels, producing approximately 2.2TB of
information.\footnote{Assuming the data set is represented using 32-bit
	floating point representation 
	($8192^3 = 512\textnormal{G}$, 
	and $4\textnormal{bytes/float} \times 8192^3 \approx 2.2\textnormal{TB}$).} 
The Idaho National Lab is also producing
high resolution scans of $2048^3$ voxels,
with each scan producing approximately 34.4GB of data.
Table~\ref{table:targetedDataSets} lists test data sets and sizes used for this
report.

The problem addressed by this project is that these real-world data sets are
too large to fit in the largest GPU memory capacities available today
(12--16GB).  Rendering these volumes requires complicated out-of-core methods that can
negatively impact visual quality and interactivity.

%\subsection{Identifying empty data}
Volume data usually contains large, coherent regions where neighboring voxels
share similar properties. These regions will likely be assigned similar color
and opacity values. If the homogeneous regions are of no interest to the user
we can try to remove as many of these neighboring voxels as possible.
One way to do this is to split the volume data set into small 
subvolumes which can be classified as relevant or irrelevant. Classification
is done by visiting each voxel in a subvolume and using a user defined 
classifier to decide if the voxel is relevant or irrelevant. Subvolumes with a
user defined percentage of irrelevant voxels can be removed.

Rectangular subvolumes are used because 3D textures on the GPU cannot
be jagged---they must be rectangular 3D arrays of image data.

This project uses a classification scheme to identify the empty data. A user defined
classifier function that maps voxel values to voxel relevance is employed to identify
which space should be removed. 

It is prohibitively expensive to analyze each voxel for relevance. Prior to using the classifier,
the empty space removal procedure from~\cite{Vidal2008-dx} is used. 
They recursively shrink the bounding volume around regions of non-empty space
starting from the outside of the volume. The algorithm gains its efficiency by
using a summed volume table to compute the volume of candidate bounding
volumes. This allows culling large amounts of unneeded data very quickly from around 
the outsides of the useful data. However, the Vidal method is an outside-in approach. To
achieve fine grained data removal we utilize a second pass with our classification method.

\subsection{Basic subvolume blocking}\label{sec:basicSubvolumeBlocking}

Basic subvolume blocking divides the original volumetric data set into small,
uniformly sized subvolumes. Each subvolume is sent to the GPU
as an individual 3D texture (one texture is generated for each subvolume). 
Algorithm~\ref{alg:initGpuTexture}
shows the method for generating a small 3D texture, $T_{i,j,k}$ for a subvolume
$S_{i,j,k}$.

The basic approach does not reduce the size of the data on the GPU, but does
improve cache performance if the subvolumes are sized according to texture
cache size. In order to reduce the amount of data sent to the GPU we must have 
a way to determine which subvolumes are relevant to the visualization through
a classification process.

\subsection{Subvolume blocking with classification}\label{sec:subvolumeBlockingWithClassification}

To facilitate easy data removal, the basic subvolume blocking approach can be extended to 
include a classification step that identifies subvolumes relevant to the desired visualization. 
\textit{Relevant} subvolumes are expected to contribute in some way to the visualization, otherwise 
a subvolume is \textit{irrelevant}. Algorithm~\ref{alg:partitionAndThreshold} shows how the classification 
step is merged  with the basic subdivision algorithm (Algorithm~\ref{alg:initGpuTexture}).

Determining if a subvolume is relevant requires examining each voxel in the
volume to determine the voxel relevance. The user must supply the classifier
function, the minimum voxel relevance threshold, and a total relevant voxel
threshold. If the number of relevant voxels in the subvolume is above the total
relevant voxel threshold then the subvolume is relevant to the visualization.
Algorithm~\ref{alg:threasholdSubVolume} shows one way to determine subvolume
relevance from a voxel classifier ($C_{r}$), classification threshold ($t_{min}$),
and the relevant voxel threshold ($s_{min}$).

\begin{algorithm}[]
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]  
		\Procedure{PartitionAndThreshold}{$V$}
		\For{$i\gets 0 .. N_x$} \Comment{For each subvolume}  
		\For{$j\gets 0 .. N_y$}   
		\For{$k\gets 0 .. N_z$}   
		\If{\textit{subvolume i,j,k is relevant}} 
		\State \Call{InitGpuTexture}{i, j, k, V} \Comment{Send to GPU}
		\EndIf
		\EndFor
		\EndFor
		\EndFor
		\EndProcedure
	\end{algorithmic}
	\caption{Partition $V$ into subvolumes with thresholding.}

\end{algorithm}

	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\Procedure{IsSubvolumeRelevant}{$S_{i,j,k}, C_{r}, t_{min}, s_{min}$}
		\State $sum \gets 0$  \Comment{Relevant voxels found so far.}
		
		\ForAll{voxels in $S_{i,j,k}$}
		
		\State $r \gets$ \textit{voxel relevance from $C_{r}$} \Comment{Run classifier on voxel.}
		\If{\textit{$r > t_{min}$}} 
		\State $sum \gets sum + 1$  \Comment{Voxel is relevant}
		\EndIf
		\EndFor

		\State \Return true \Comment{$S_{i,j,k}$ is relevant}
		\Else
		\State \Return false \Comment{$S_{i,j,k}$ is irrelevant}
		\EndIf
		\EndProcedure
	\end{algorithmic}
	\caption{Determine if $S_{i,j,k}$ is relevant to the visualization. $C_r$ is the classifier function,
		$t_{\min}$ is the classification threshold, and $s_{\min}$ is the relevant voxel threshold.}
